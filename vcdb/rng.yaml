brief: Random Number Generator
size: 0x1000
desc: |
  A hardware random number generator which measures thermal noise to produce
  random numbers. A driver for this exists in the linux tree, although no other
  documentation has been released.
registers:
  0x0:
    name: CTRL
    brief: RNG control register
    bits:
      0:
        name: RBGEN
        desc: |
          Writing a 1 enables the RNG, writing a 0 disables it.
      1:
        name: RBG2X
        desc: |
          Writing a 1 here doubles the rate of random numbers, but decreases
          the "randomness".
  0x4:
    name: STATUS
    brief: RNG status (available word count)
    bits:
      24-31:
        name: AVAIL_COUNT
        desc: Number of bytes available through the DATA register.
      0-23:
        name: SKIP
        desc: |
          Writing a number here makes the RNG skip the number of words. Linux
          writes 0x40000 here at initialization to skip some words until
          "randomness" is high enough.
  0x8:
    name: DATA
    brief: Random number output
    desc: |
      If STATUS.AVAIL_COUNT is greater than 0, a 32-bit random word can be read
      from this register.
