  The BCM2835 system has a number of clocks for the various components which are
  driven either by a PLL or the external 19.2 MHz oscillator. Known clocks are
  the core clock (CM_VPU), the system timer clock (PM_TIME) which controls the
  speed of the system timer and the GPIO clocks which are documented in the
  Raspberry Pi peripheral documentation. The interactions between the clocks are
  mostly unknown. The core clock affects at least execution speed on the
  videocore processor and the speed of the mini uart.
