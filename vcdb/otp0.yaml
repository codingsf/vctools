  Not accessible via the ARM core.

  This is an (undocumented) interface to the OTP (unofficially codenamed Dragon)
  used by bootcode.bin (and probably other parts of the bootchain.) It appears
  to start repeating after the 128th word. 0x80 == 0x00, 0x81 = 0x01 and so
  forth. This gives us an OTP storage of 128 words[32 bit] or 512 bytes.

  Here is code for generating a bootcode.bin for dumping the contents of your
  OTP over serial: https://gist.github.com/3972820.
